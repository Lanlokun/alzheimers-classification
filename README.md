# Alzheimer's MRI Classification with Decision Trees

This project focuses on classifying Alzheimer's disease stages using T1-weighted MRI scans and Decision Tree-based models. The dataset used is a preprocessed version available on Kaggle: [Best Alzheimer's MRI Dataset - 99% Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukechugh/best-alzheimer-mri-dataset-99-accuracy).

## Models Evaluated
- Decision Tree (CART)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## Objectives
- Compare the performance of different Decision Tree variants.
- Evaluate models based on metrics like Accuracy, F1-Score, AUC, and Confusion Matrix.

## Highlights
- XGBoost achieved the highest classification performance.
- Ensemble methods significantly improved accuracy over standard Decision Trees.

## Usage
Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the experiments and results.
